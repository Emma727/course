* Concepts:
    * **Data visualization** refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visualobjcts (e.g. points, lines or bars) contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in data analysis or data science.
    * **information visualization** is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition.

You are aware of just 0.7% of what you experience.

* Universal Capabilities
    * Typically in less than 1/10s
